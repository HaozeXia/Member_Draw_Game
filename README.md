# Member_Draw_Game
For instance, during Easter Sale, a retailer can use your software to create a lucky draw game. In the game, a customer is given entries equivalent to the size of its purchase after their single-purchase final balance, after discounts, reach a specific amount, say $50. Once the competition time ends, the retailer draws winners and the winning customers will get points added to their membership account; customers can use these points for future purchases if they wish.
